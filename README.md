# SMART-INDICATOR-TURN-OFF-SYSTEM-FOR-TWO-WHEELERS-USING-PROXIMITY-AND-LIMIT-SENSORS-
This project presents a smart indicator system using an IMU sensor to detect tilt, a distance sensor to measure vehicle movement, and a manual override for safety. The microcontroller processes these inputs to automatically activate or deactivate indicators, reducing human error and improving road safety.
